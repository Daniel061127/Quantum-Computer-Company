## ## Composition of Gates
- Single-qubit gates performed using microwave pulses through a resonator
- Two-qubit gates achieved via virtual photon exchange with the resonator and spin-spin coupling
- Includes standard rotational gates (e.g., Rx, Ry, Rz)
- Gate operations involve forming double quantum dots within carbon nanotubes using gate electrodes
## Weakness
- Relatively new technology in the quantum computing landscape
- Currently in development stage, not yet widely commercially available
- Manufacturing complexity of ultra-pure carbon nanotubes and precise integration
## [Roadmap for Future Developments](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en/news/new-round-financing-c12-quantum-processors-start-launched-two-x-alumni)
1. Scaling up to 1000-qubit processors within the next few years
2. Releasing first five-qubit chip by the end of 2025
3. Demonstrating long-distance entanglement between 2 qubits
4. Accelerating industrial co-development partnerships
5. Continuing research to improve qubit stability and reduce error rates
