### Composition of Gates
- [[Cat Qubits]]
- [[Clifford + Toffoli]]
### Strengths
- Cat qubit technology reduces harware requirements by up to 200 times compated to competing approaches
- Aims to produce "6-nines" with 99.9999% fidelity
### Weakness
- While cat qubits are highly resistant to bit-flip errors, they still need to address phase-flip errors, which requires additional error correction processes
- As a relatively new company (founded in 2020) compared to tech giants like Google and IBM, Alice & Bob may face challenges in terms of resources and experience in scaling up their technology.
### [Roadmap for Future Developments](https://alice-bob.com/blog/alice-bob-2030-roadmap-to-useful-quantum-computers/)
1. Master the Cat Qubit
2. Build a logical Qubit
3. Fault-tolerant Quantum Computing
4. Universal Quantum Computing
5. Useful Quantum Computing
