## Composition of Gates
- Single-qubit gates, including the H (Hadamard) with 99.8% fidelity
- Two-qubit gates, including the CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate with 96.4%

## Strengths
- Full-stack quantum hardware-software integration
- Cloud-based access to quantum resources
- Compatibility with various quantum hardware platforms

## Weakness
- Recently announced plans to exit direct quantum computing development
- Relatively small number of qubits compared to some competitors

## [Roadmap for Future Developments](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/baidu-donates-quantum-computing-lab-to-baqis-echoing-alibabas-move/)
1. Donating quantum computing laboratory to BAQIS
2. Shifting focus from direct quantum hardware development
3. Potential continued collaboration with academic institutions in quantum research
