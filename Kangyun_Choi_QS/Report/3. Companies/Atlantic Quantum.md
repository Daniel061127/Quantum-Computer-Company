### Composition of Gates
- Single-Qubit Gates with 99.97% fidelity
- Two-Qubit Gates with 99.9% fidelity

### Strengths
- Record-low error rates for superconducting qubits
- Faster clock speeds due to superconducting circuits
- More scalable architecture with collocated control electronics
- Longer coherence times compared to transmon qubits

### Weakness
- Using fluxonium qubits operating at lower frequencies to reduce noise and errors
- Implementing a transmon coupler for flexible two-qubit gates
- Integrating qubits and cryogenic controls into a modular chip stack

### [Roadmap for Future Developments](https://engineventures.com/companies/atlantic-quantum)
1. Developing scalable superconducting quantum computers based on fluxonium qubits
2. Enhancing quantum processor readout through innovations in quantum-limited amplifiers
3. Improving coherence time and reducing error rates in quantum operations
4. Creating high-security, high-performance quantum systems for national defense applications
5. Advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing for commercial and defense use
