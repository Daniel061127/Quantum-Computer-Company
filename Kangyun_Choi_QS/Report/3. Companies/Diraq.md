## Composition of Gates
- 2-Qubit gates in [[SiMOS]] with fidelity of 99% [Article](https://diraq.com/newsdesk/diraq-drives-two-qubit-gate-accuracy-in-cmos-to-above-99) [Article](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/diraq-reports-99-9-qubit-control-accuracy-with-imec-produced-silicon-quantum-dot/)
- 
## Strengths
- Uses silicon CMOS qubits compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes
- Potential for scaling up to millions of qubits on a single chip
- [Achieved 99.9% control accuracy for a qubit using industry-standard CMOS materials](https://www.innovationaus.com/diraq-milestone-boosts-quantum-computing-chance/)
## Weakness
- Limited to specific problem types (primarily optimization)
- Not suitable for all quantum algorithms (e.g., Shor's algorithm)
- Debate over quantum speedup for certain problems
