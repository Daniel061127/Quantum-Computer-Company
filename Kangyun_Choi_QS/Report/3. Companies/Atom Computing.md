### Composition of Gates
- Single-qubit gates
- Two-qubit controlled phase (CZ) gates with 99.5% fidelity
- Three-qubit CCZ gates with 97.9% fidelity
### Strengths
- Highly scalable architecture using neutral atoms
- Long coherence times (>40s demonstrated)
- Room-temperature operation
- Ability to pack qubits tightly due to lack of charge interference
### Weakness
- Quantum error correction still needed for large-scale computations
- Relatively new technology compared to superconducting qubits
### [Roadmap for Future Developments](https://engineventures.com/companies/atlantic-quantum)
1. Developing scalable superconducting quantum computers based on fluxonium qubits
2. Enhancing quantum processor readout through innovations in quantum-limited amplifiers
3. Improving coherence time and reducing error rates in quantum operations
4. Creating high-security, high-performance quantum systems for national defense applications
5. Advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing for commercial and defense use
