### Composition of Gates
- 
- Single-Qubit Gates
- [[Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate]]
- Universal Gate Set
### Strengths
- High connectivity between qubits
- High coherence times
- Room temperature operation
- Compact, commercially viable systems for industrial settings
### Weakness
- Error rates for two-qubit gates (around 1.5 × 10^-2 on average) are higher compared to single-qubit gates (approximately 3 × 10^-4 on average)

### [Roadmap for Future Developments]()
1. Develop modular devices for quantum research
2. Create entire systems such as ion-trap quantum computers
3. Integrate quantum systems as accelerators within hybrid supercomputer setups
4. Advance quantum-HPC integration
5. Expand cloud access for researchers and industry partners
