## Composition of Gates
- Qubit Fidelity is not measured
## Strengths
- World's largest quantum annealer with over 5,000 qubits and 15-way connectivity
- Proven capability in solving optimization problems
- High system availability (99.9%) and uptime
- Integration with classical and high-performance computing systems
- Established track record with over 100 customer organizations
## Weakness
- Limited to specific problem types (primarily optimization)
- Not suitable for all quantum algorithms (e.g., Shor's algorithm)
- Debate over quantum speedup for certain problems
## [Roadmap for Future Developments](http://dwavesys.com/media/xvjpraig/clarity-roadmap_digital_v2.pdf)
1. Developing quantum distributions for generative AI
2. Enhancing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) architectures
3. Integrating GPUs with Leap quantum cloud service
4. Expanding into gate-model quantum computing
5. Advancing quantum AI solutions for more efficient model training and reduced energy consumption
