The name “cat qubits” is inspired by the relationship between Schrodinger's cat and quantum physics. In the legendary thought experiment, a cat exists in two states – alive and dead – at the same time. In a similar way, except in reality compared to the fictitious feline, a cat qubit exists in two quantum states at the same time.
