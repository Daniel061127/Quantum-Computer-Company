Full Name: Toffoli Gate
What it does: A three-qubit gate with two control qubits and one target qubit. The target qubit is flipped only if both control qubits are in |1>.
Use: It's universal for calssical reversible computation and plays a role in quantum error correction and certain quantum algorithm.
