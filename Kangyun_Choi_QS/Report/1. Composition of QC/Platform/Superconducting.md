초전도
- Artificial atoms made from superconducting electronic circuits that function as quantum bits

-  Uses the ground and excited states of a superconducting circuit as the two qubit states, denoted as |g⟩ and |e⟩. Requires a Josephson junction, where electrical current flows through quantum tunneling

-  Scalable and compatible with existing microfabrication technologies
- Controlled using microwave pulses
- Operates at extremely low temperatures
- Susceptible to flux noise and critical-current noise
