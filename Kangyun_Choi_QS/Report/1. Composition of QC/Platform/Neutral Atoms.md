- uses individual neutral atoms to store and process quantum information.

- Long coherence times
- Individual atoms can be addressed and controlled
- Can operate at room temperature (no need for extreme cooling)
- Utilizes Rydberg states for atom-atom interactions
- Particularly suitable for quantum simulation
