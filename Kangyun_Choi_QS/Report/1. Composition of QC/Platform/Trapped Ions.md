이온트랩
 - Individual ions held in place by electromagnetic fields, used as quantum bits.

- Quantum information is stored in the electronic or nuclear spin states of the trapped ions. Uses a Paul trap to confine ions in two dimensions

- Long coherence times
- High-fidelity operations
- Ability to entangle distant qubits
- Requires complex colling emchanisms to reach very low temperatures
